# emoji-predictor-using-RNN
This project is an emoji prediction model using an LSTM-based RNN and GloVe word embeddings. Given short text inputs, the model predicts the most relevant emoji from a set of predefined classes. The code includes data preprocessing, training with two LSTM model variations, and predictions with visual output using the `emoji` library.
